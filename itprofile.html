<h1> IT Profile </h1>
<h2> 1. Personal Information </h2>
<p>
        Name: Phan Thanh Loi <br>
        Student Code: S3864188 <br>
        Email address: s3864188@rmit.edu.vn <br>
        Spoken Language: Vietnamese language, English and I am planning to learn Japanese. <br>
        Hobby: Reading book (mostly Japan light novel), listening to music, playing games and I used to like playing football.  <br>
</p>
<h2> 2. Interest in IT </h2>
<p>  - What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?  </p>
      + There are 2 things that are of interest to me in IT. One is about IT security: how to secure your own information on websites or apps that are easily stolen by hackers because most of the technological advancements were born in the era of technology 4.0, making life easy and enjoyable. Yet the issue of information disclosure can be a challenge, because there will be a lot of people are using it to make money or slander. Others are game developers, like how to develop a game on a small scale, because I'm passionate about testing all the gameplay styles in the games to choose which game I feel is appropriate to my own standards.  <br>
      + Maybe when I first touched Internet since mid-2013 because at that time I didn’t know the exist of network or online social medias, just playing some offline games such as Chicken Invasion or old- fashioned Plant vs Zombie that already exist on computer  <br>
      + 5 years ago, throughout playing online games, from video that they show what they developed a game from the beginning. At first I looked, I confused and didn't understand what they were doing because the programming language was something completely new. But also from that I was slowly interested in learning about the language and some other fields of information technology such as network security, processing, transmission and data collection. <br>

<p> - Why did you choose to come to RMIT?  </p>
      + Choosing RMIT University where I will study is not my decision because in the beginning, I choose FPT University to start learning, hone my skills as well as to adapt to not old but not new learning-environment. But my family wants me to learn in a better environment and easy to succeed in the future by having a variety of skills than other universities in Vietnam.  <br>

<p> -What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </p>
      + In this career research, I expect to know the programming language most often, researching more details on how to develop a game from beginner to advanced, from small scale to large project. Or how to develop a network security system by strengthening the firewall and limiting the amount of unauthorized access from outside. <br>

     <br><br>

     •This position will help me a lot while I work, typically research and work, with no less or more revenue. Simultaneously , the company is operating in a good environment, as a number of foreign officials who have been studying and obtaining long term experience, having great conditions for sharing experience with each other as well as gathering, improving understanding and familiarizing the workplace. <br>
     • According to this company, if we wish to enter, we must meet the criteria set by them, such as having a sufficient English language to communicate and report, having at least 2 years of experience on the Unity Platform (2D/3D) in the C # programming language. At the same time, they will be highly valued if you have the ability to develop games, use tween libraries like DoTween, and good at game physics. <br>
     • Right now, I have a simple knowledge of Unity and not a lot of C # languages as most of the online learning, I have a couple of lessons but I use almost none because of the time and some issues associated with installing C # program language framework. And also, I haven't had experience in a collaborative working atmosphere until the last year to experience it. Yet I can speak fluent English, but neither good nor bad.  <br>
     • My plan is still formulated, but it could be temporary because it will alter drastically over time. There are actually 2 plans: 1 is to spend time studying and reading C # or C++ programming languages online, make the most of what you have learned to contribute to development and learning. And the second is versatile in a joint work environment, the plan is not yet responsive. The reason is clear, I haven't ex the working environment, except for group work, I used to work with small groups and class groups during 3 years of high school. So I don't think about it as well, but I also want to try my experience in a physically challenging and professional working environment as a trainee and get to know and learn from the experience of those who came before me.  <br>

<p> - What do the results of these tests mean for you?  <br>
  After I finished testing the total of 3 tests of "Free Personality Test" from 16 Personalities, 'What's your Learning Style?' From EducationPlaner.org and 'The Big Five Personality Test' from Open Source Psychometrics Project, I was quite satisfied with the result. Because my character and my way of thinking were measured, although somewhat in opposition. Usually in terms of communication, I never communicate with people, so I'm slow in initiating discussions, and that's one of the reason why I've experienced a number of difficulties in getting used to the learning atmosphere in foreign universities. But for someone I know, I typically interact, more or less depending on the topic. <br>
</p>
<p> - How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?  <br>
  I don't think the above results will affect my behavior much when I work with a team. Although my general style is an individual who doesn't talk much, I'm still a person who is simple to speak to, approachable, good group activity. Along with learning quickly by listening and comprehension, interacting with a group is easier when you collect feedback and learn from other members of the group.  <br>
</p>
<p> - How should you take this into account when forming a team?  <br>
  It depends on the role of each person, but when it comes to forming a team, not only me, but every member of the group always has to consider some of the strengths and weaknesses of myself that make up my weaknesses. Others will account for and their strengths will compensate for the other cons of the group. Nobody is good at holistic, nobody is perfect. And I just make sure that encouraging each other to work together is even more valuable. Typically, always finding new and unique ideas, not in touch, the communication skills of the members are constantly improved, the method of making decisions carefully, properly, effectively and The organization is becoming more and more disciplined, the members are becoming more and more aware. Around the same time, if you don't mention your advantages and limitations, it's doubtful that people will understand and help you improve. Gradually, the strength of teamwork would be reduced, impacting other members, including yourself so that should be avoided. <br>

<h2> 5. Project Ideas </h2>
<p> -Overview:  <br>
     > I and my friend are working on a big project to create an MMORPG game on the PC platform. It was inspired by the famous Japanese light novel series, Sword Art Online, known as SAO and it was adapted into manga, anime. Although best known as Sword Art Online, SAO's story is not directly related to this title, but it revolves around a lot of virtual worlds-with a lot of different games. Every world has its own features and properties for Kirito and his teammates to explore. This game will look forward to the sequel and also the new season of the series:"Unital Ring" or also referred to as the virtual world of the MMORPG Survival Game.
</p>
<p> -Motivation:  <br>
    > The source of encouragement for me to join the project is simple. I have a great passion for understanding and exploiting each story in many light novels in Japan because they have many selections. That is quite true for me since I delight about the game-oriented towards the story and gameplay and feel excited about it. At the same time, I started the project after the release of the new light novel series, confirming that the 21st volume was published at the end of 2018, and maybe but not sure that is the last part to end more than 10 years of the way it is headed. Around the time, my friend and I decided the attempting to build a game based on the plot in the novel as a gift to the popular anime Sword Art Online, although the author's official account on the Twitter site did not confirm that the Unital Ring part was the last season.
</p>
<p> -Description: <br>
     + Genre: Singleplayer, MMORPG, Survival, Role-playing, action, adventure, anime and visual novel. <br>
     + Context: Based on the light novel Sword Art Online sequel and also the latest section of the Sword Art Online series, Unital Ring. Set one month after the return of Kirito and Asuna from 'Underworld.' Having developed a physical body in the real world, Alice had joined them. But their peace abruptly came to an end [1]. Kirito and Alice and Asuna accidentally got caught up in a “Survival MMO” during a "discussion" at New Aincrad's bungalow and everything fell apart. Every world that runs its core with Seed is pulled into a place called the Unital Ring and there everyone must survive because dead is lost account. <br>
     + Gameplay: We are looking for a different way of integrating sustainability, such as the introduction of a wellness bar, a water bar, a food bar with any of the other features under consideration. Around the same time , in addition to having sword battles such as parrying, defending and deflecting with the ability to team up to 4 AIs, we are also working on a complex system of skill trees that can be easily approached. In addition , the game will include new improvements as well as the introduction of a variety of new classes to give players more options after finishing the storyline. <br>
</p>
<p> + Features: <br>
      • Faithful to the original work: <br>
      Kirigaya Kazuto (real-life name of Kirito) planning out the upcoming birthdays for Asuna and himself. Kirito eventually decides to full-dive into New Aincrad, a recreation of the floating castle that now resides within Alfheim Online (ALO). Studying from school inside the loghouse that he calls home, Kirito finds his school studying disturbed by a catfight between Asuna and cat ears Alice. But suddenly there was a huge commotion, Kirito and the two of them went outside to see what was wrong, when they saw ... That red color was not the sky, but a massive hexagonal pattern fiercely filling the space above us. Emerging on the surfaces of the shapes were the alternating words: [Warning] and [System Announcement]. <br>
      “Kirito-kun…” <br>
      Asuna weakly called my name again. I tightly grasped her slender hand, as in my mind a vivid memory of «that day» was resurrected… the day on which I had seen the very same sky four years ago.[2][3]  <br>
      • Meet with your favourite characters. <br>
      • Experience the new mode between MMORPG and Survival. <br>
</p>
<p> -Tools and Technologies  <br>
     > That project is implemented mostly on the Unity platform, the platform selected by many game publishers, and used for creating quality products. As for graphic design, my friend used Adobe Illustrator and Sketchup to develop the background as well as fix it. And about the general hardware of the PC is recommended to make the project included one large screen or 2 screens, GPU requires an RTX 2080 will be very helpful in handling all post-lighting, lighting and shadow effects, CPU requires Core i7 to work properly, but Core i5 is recommended to see if the game works well for weak machines, and lastly RAM is at least 16G-Skill required. <br>
</p>
<p> -Skill requires: <br>
        • A passion for video games; <br>
        • Strong analytical frame of mind; <br>
        • Ability to work as part of a team; <br>
        • Proficiency in programming languages, such as C# and C++;  <br>
        • Basic drawing and 3D design skills;  <br>
        • Solid problem-solving skills;  <br>
        • Good storytelling ability; <br>
        • Creative thinking skills to create new Gameplay and solve a variety of everyday game design issues, including but not limited to gameplay, levels, and interfaces; <br>
        • Understand the balance of complex game systems; <br>
        • Basic programming knowledge to easily understand scenarios; <br>
        • Experience with game reward system; <br>
</p>
<p> -Outcome: <br>
      > If that project is successful, depending on our individual opinion, we may likely sell to a major gaming company like Bandai Namco so they can continue to develop, update, and create the expansion pack for players who want to continue to stick. The reason we choose is simply that we don't have the conditions to operate. Although it has just started for a long time, it is still progressing slowly, there are still some shortcomings such as human resources, time, money as well as limited experience in building games. At the same time, if this game can make a breakthrough through gameplay, storyline, but it may not be popular because it is not an individual or a group that can do a great project right from the start.
